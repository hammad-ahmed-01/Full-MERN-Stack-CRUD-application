## Project Description

Following is a simple dry run of this application: <br>
The Project has a client side and a server side connected through a file 'index.js' in client > src > api. When a user makes a request, lets say creates a post in form, the onhandle submit function is called which inturn calls createPost function in actions > posts.js which is connected to a function on the server side server > controller > posts.js that in case of createPost adds the data from the form to the mongodb database. On the client side, data is passed to reducers which returns the data on the components > posts > post.js on client side.
